# My-Name
This is a a Project I created for anyone just starting out in CSS and Open-Source. The Project as of now contains an example div, you can add a similar section with your name and something about yourself, or you could go all the way out and add something extra you'd want too. Consider this as a learning exercise and your initial step into the world of contribution and Open-Source. If you like the idea of this project make sure to share it with your friends. You can see what the Web Page currently looks like, [Here](https://vansh-goel.github.io/My-Name/)

## How to get Started
- I would like to suggest you to get some hands-on experience with HTML and Basic CSS first on your local machine
- Once you're done with that, you can get started [Here](https://github.com/nishantattrey07/nishantattrey07.github.io), Nishant has created a similar project for you to hone your HTML skills, and it's ReadMe section has all you need to know about Forking and Cloning a repository, and submitting a pull-request
- This is a learning experience so don't worry much about it, just get started and let's all build this WebPage together
- Happy Contributing!!
